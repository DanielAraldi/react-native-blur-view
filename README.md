| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `type`         | Color type of the overlay.                           | `light`                                                                       | All      |
| `radius`       | Blur radius `0` - `100`.                             | `10`                                                                          | All      |
| `blurStyle`    | Style for the `BlurView` component.                  | `[{ zIndex: 9999, backgroundColor: 'transparent' }, StyleSheet.absoluteFill]` | iOS      |
| `contentStyle` | Style for the `BlurView` component children content. | `{ zIndex: 9999, position: 'absolute' }`                                      | iOS      |

By default, the style property is `{ zIndex: 9999, backgroundColor: 'transparent' }`.

In **Android**, you can use `style` to set blur style content.

An important detail, when a value less than `0` or greater than `100` are provided for `radius` property, the `radius` is clipped.

## How `BlurView` works with and without children?

- **With children**: The blur effect is applied to the background behind the `BlurView`, while the children content remains sharp and visible on top.

```tsx
return (
  <View style={styles.container}>
    <BlurView style={styles.blurView}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>
        This text will appear above the blur effect, the blur effect doesn't
        applied about it.
      </Text>

      <Button title="Click me" />
    </BlurView>
  </View>
);
```

- **Without children**: The blur effect affects whatever content is rendered below or above the `BlurView` in the component tree.

```tsx
return (
  <>
    <BlurView style={styles.container} />

    <Text style={styles.title}>
      This text will be blurred when it be behind or above BlurView!
    </Text>
  </>
);
```

## Expo

In Expo, you need to convert to a [custom development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/) or use [prebuild](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/). You can use also React Native without Expo.
