## Platform Differences

### Android

On Android platforms, the component utilizes the BlurView library to offer native blur effects with hardware-accelerated rendering.

### iOS

On iOS all types are supported by default. However, on Android they are RGBA colors to simulate the same blur color.

## Expo

In Expo, you need to convert to a [custom development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/) or use [prebuild](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/). You can use also React Native without Expo.

## TypeScript Support

Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions!

```ts
import { BlurViewType, BlurViewProps } from '@danielsaraldi/react-native-blur';

export const INITIAL_BLUR_TYPE: BlurViewType = 'x-light';

export interface CustomBlurViewProps extends BlurViewProps {
  // ...
}
```
